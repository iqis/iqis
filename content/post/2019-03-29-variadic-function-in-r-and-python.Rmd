In R, one uses `...` to denote variadic arguments in a function definition, which means the function can take any number of arguments, without having been pre-defined. 

The same is true in Python. `*args` and `*kwargs`

An anecdote, the proper name of `...`, according to the R core team, is _dot-dot-dot_, not _eclipse_. You may make a fool of yourself trying to correct someone using _dot-dot-dot_.
