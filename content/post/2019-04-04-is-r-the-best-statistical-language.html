<p>Or, <em>Why R is better than Python</em>.</p>
<p>R is the programming language most suitable for working with data. The language is extremely easy to get started with, has minimalistic syntax, and has been inarguably the fastest growing language in the analytics domain for a number of years. R is the only purpose-specific language that <a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">ranks top 10</a> in the PYPL index.</p>
<p>Personally, R takes about 85% of all my time in front of a code editor, and is the first language that I felt have mastered. During the past two or three years, I have accomplished more with R than with any other language combined.</p>
<p>Python, while making advances in nearly all fronts of computing, with an edge in deep learning, has in recent years risen as a strong contender in R’s arena. Despite heightened public enthusiasm, however, it is not very likely to supplant R’s dominance in data science as the go-to language.</p>
<p>The key factor comes from usability. Python does not serve the user nearly as well as R does. In stern and stark contrast with Python’s reputation, beginners of either language often find Python’s syntax convoluted, its program verbose, and usage inconvenient. This is not on the fault of Python <em>per se</em>. R is far more superior in usability because it is built from the ground up as an interactive language.</p>
<p>This article is going to be an in-detail analysis on R’s syntactical features, comparing with that of Python side-by-side.</p>
<p>Some people arrive at “Python is better than R.” via “Python is a powerful, general purpose language”, and “R is a domain-specific language”.</p>
<p>The statements are correct, but the conclusion is not. What’s wrong? According to the (Rule of the Least Power)[<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html" class="uri">https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower.html</a>], a princple codified by the W3C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Programming] in less powerful languages increases the flexibility with which information can be reused: the less powerful the language, the more you can do with the data stored in that language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is reasonable to say that, <strong>R is as better than Python as it is less powerful</strong>.</p>
<p>To quote a great computer scientist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</p>
<p>— Alan Perlis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, with respect to data science, Python is a lower-level programming language, and is most suitable for use beneath the friendly user interface laid out by R. Specifically, most deep learning capabilities in Python, such as <em>Keras</em>, <em>TensorFlow</em>, all have mature adaptations in R.</p>
<p>For most people, a familarity with Python will only be useful for reading and porting existing codebases.</p>
<p>Using Python to approach analytical issues is like making sculpture with a chainsaw.</p>

<p>It is possible to achieve great results, however only by way of struggling with the tool.</p>
<div id="r-has-a-mature-ecosystem" class="section level3">
<h3>R has a mature ecosystem</h3>
<p>Rkward, Rcommander, Jamovi, and else.</p>
<p>Python does not have a sophisticated IDE or text editor for analytics. Wrangler from yhat seems to be stagnant in development Spyder is …</p>
<p>Jupyter is all about the “Py” in its name. I rarely see Julia or R user use the notebook.</p>
<p>It is … to remember that Python is a language with a record of hard fork between version 2 and 3, aftermath still evident of this day. Nobody has counted the time when some Python novice trodded onto a v.2-only solution on StackOverflow, and pulled his hair in agony.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-is-simple" class="section level3">
<h3>R is simple</h3>
<p>R is a very simple language, expecially in its syntax.<br />
Thanks to its functional programming root, in R, everything that exists is an object, and everything that happens is a function. This characteristic is not, from any point of view, unique to R; but R syntax makes it quite obvious.</p>
<p>Everything that happens is a function.</p>
<p>To attach a library:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(caret)
#or
require(caret)</code></pre>
<p>To return a value from a funciton:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>function(){
        return(1)
}</code></pre>
<p>There are some that adopts C-like characteristics, purposed for imperative programming.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>for (i in 1:5){
        print(i)
}

if (TRUE){
        print(&quot;yes&quot;)
} else {
print(&quot;no&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<p>The above can be easily re-written with keywords quoted with ``, in a purely functional style, as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>`for`(i, 1:5, print(i))
`if`(TRUE, print(&quot;yes&quot;), print(&quot;no&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>There are also special operators, such as assignment <code>&lt;-</code> and subset<code>[</code>/<code>[[</code>/<code>$</code>, which can be re-written the same way:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Assign an object
a &lt;- 1
# is equivalent to:
`&lt;-`(a, 1)

# Subset an object
profile &lt;- list(name = &quot;mike&quot;, gender = &quot;male&quot;, id = 7)

profile[1]
profile[&quot;name&quot;]
profile[[&quot;gender&quot;]]
profile$id
# are equivalent to:
`[`(profile, 1)
`[`(profile, &quot;name&quot;)
`[[`(profile, &quot;gender&quot;)
`$`(profile, id)</code></pre>
<p>In Python, in the follwing code example, keyword <code>import</code> does invoke underlying functions. But it is very obfuscated.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import numpy as np</code></pre>

<div id="data-types" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>vector</code></li>
<li>Homogeneous, flat, 1D</li>
<li><code>list</code></li>
<li>Heterogeneous, recursive, 1D</li>
<li><code>matrix</code>,</li>
<li>Vector of vectors, 2D</li>
<li><code>data.frame</code></li>
<li>List of vectors or lists, 2D</li>
<li><code>array</code></li>
<li>Homogeneous, 1 to Inf dimensions</li>
</ul>
<p>Perl has <code>array</code>, <code>hash</code> Python has `</p>
</div>
<div id="namespace" class="section level3">
<h3>Namespace</h3>
<p>R has a convenient namespace and symbol resolution scheme. It is very similar to <a href="https://perlmaven.com/namespaces-and-packages">that of Perl</a>, and <a href="https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/chapters/35-modules/lessons/80-modules-as-namespaces">that of Ruby</a> and uses <code>::</code> to qualify symbols within a namespace.</p>
<p>In R, a namespace can only be defined by a package, and it is not likely possible to have nested namespaces.</p>
<p>One would use <code>library()</code> or <code>reuiqre()</code> to attach a namespace (from a package) to the search path. Once a namespace is attached to the search path, all consequent invokations of a symbol will be evaluated throught the namesapce, until it is detached with <code>detach()</code>.</p>
<p><code>environment</code>s and <code>list</code>s can also be used in the place of a namespace when evaluating a symbol, with <code>attach()</code> and <code>with()</code>.</p>
<p>A namespace searth path determines the search order for a symbol(name). The search will begin at the most recently attached namespace. there is no need to qualify a symbol.</p>
<p>Python follows Java style to use the <code>.</code> notation. It is mandatory to qualify a symbol.</p>
<p>Otherwise, scoping rules are similar between the two languages.</p>
<p>This makes Python scripts more verbose, and breaks the analyst’s rythem when rapidly executing exploratory tasks.</p>

<p><a href="http://panicz.github.io/pamphlet/">A Pamphlet against R</a> In spite of the porovocative title, this pamphlet has only a minute amount of reference to R, and weighs more on discussing the benefits of Scheme, a Lisp dialect. <a href="https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">R Inferno</a> This is <em>the</em> epic on R pecularities and screw-ups. Contrasting with the the tile of the equivalent publication regarding JavaScript, <a href="http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/">JavaScript <em>Garden</em></a>, R users’ self-hate (or, self-pity) is quite evident.</p>
