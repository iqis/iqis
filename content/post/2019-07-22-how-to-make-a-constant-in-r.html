                        -- R. Constant</code></pre>
<p>A constant is an object which value cannot be altered once assigned. There are some sound arguments for a constant; but by and large, just like strong typing or inheritance, a constant is not a very meaningful feature in data science programming.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it would be quite interesting to see if it was possible to implement such feature in our language, R. The following implementation will take advantage of <code>makeActiveBinding()</code> from the base package. Indeed, base R is full of treasures. Let’s have a little fun.</p>

<h3>Active binding; how it works</h3>
<p>What’s behind an “active binding” is essentially a function supplied by the user. The function gets invoked with very special rules: when the name is evaluated alone, the function is called with no argument passed to it; when the name apprears on the <em>lhs</em> of an assignment operator <code>&lt;-</code>, the function is called with the <em>rhs</em> as its only argument.</p>
<p>The following shall be a clear demonstration:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># This is a regular binding, using the ` &lt;- ` operator
reg_binding &lt;- function(x = &quot;I&#39;m a regular binding.&quot;){
  print(x)
}

# `makeActiveBinding()` works like `assign()`
makeActiveBinding(&quot;act_binding&quot;, 
                  env = parent.frame(), 
                  fun = function(x = &quot;I&#39;m an active binding.&quot;){
  print(x)
})</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: the following code blocks that evaluates <code>act_binding</code> contain a bug from RMarkdown, therefore the outputs are not printed.</em></p>
<p><code>reg_binding()</code> is called with no argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_binding()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;I&#39;m a regular binding.&quot;</code></pre>
<p><code>act_binding</code> also calls the underlying function with no argument.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>act_binding
# &quot;I&#39;m an active binding.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>reg_binding()</code> function is being passed an argument, overriding the default.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>reg_binding(&quot;This is a nice day.&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;This is a nice day.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rhs</code> string overrides the default argument of the underlying function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>act_binding &lt;- &quot;This is a nice day, too.&quot;
# &quot;This is a nice day, too.&quot;</code></pre>

<h3>Making a constant with active binding</h3>
<p>In order to make a constant, the object must resist being assigned a new value through defying the assignment operator. This is where active binding’s special behavior with <code>&lt;-</code> is useful. We can make it do nothing but mocking the user on his void attempt. The implementation goes as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>const &lt;- function(name, value){
  makeActiveBinding(substitute(name), env = parent.frame(), fun = function(.){
    if (missing(.)){
      return(value)
    } else {
      warning(&quot;You can kill me, but you can&#39;t alter my value.&quot;)
      return(NULL)
    }
  })
}</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>const()</code> function, we can make a constant called <code>foo</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>const(foo, &quot;I&#39;m R. Constant.&quot;)
foo</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;I&#39;m R. Constant.&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>foo &lt;- &quot;You must surrender!&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in (function (.) : You can kill me, but you can&#39;t alter my value.</code></pre>
<p>OK. Now let’s kill it.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rm(foo)</code></pre>
<p>Bye-bye!</p>
