<p>In R, one uses <code>...</code> to denote variadic arguments in a function definition, which means the function can take any number of arguments, without having been pre-defined.</p>
<p>The same is true in Python. <code>*args</code> and <code>*kwargs</code></p>
<p>An anecdote, the proper name of <code>...</code>, according to the R core team, is <em>dot-dot-dot</em>, not <em>eclipse</em>. I’m sure if people will understand if you use the <em>eclipse</em>, just don’t try to correct someone using <em>dot-dot-dot</em>, and make a fool of yourself.</p>
