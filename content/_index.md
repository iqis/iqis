# Siqi Zhang

#### ...is a Data Analyst, R and Shiny developer.

From 2012, I have made a living writing R codes. My works have served several car makers, a fast-serve restaurant chain, a brewery and an equity fund. I've also authored course contents for an online learning platform. With some rants, this blog is mostly good words about R. 

I have developed several R packages for fun; I'm hoping to get them on CRAN. I use `require()`, because it is a verb. I advocate for reproduceable and extensible analysis. I also know a little of (by order of fondness): Clojure, JavaScript (React, d3.js), Excel & VBA, Python, C++. I went to Michigan State University and University of Maryland; Both are quite alright. I support the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org).
