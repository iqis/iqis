# Siqi Zhang

#### ...is a Data Analyst, R and Shiny developer.

From 2012, I have made a living writing R codes. My works have served several car makers, several drug makers, a brewery and an equity fund. I've also helped [an online learning platform](http://www.datacamp.com){target="_blank"} with course contents. With some rants, this blog is mostly good words about R. 

I have developed several R packages for fun; I'm hoping to get them on CRAN. I use `require()`, because it is a verb. I also know some (by order of proficiency): JavaScript (jQuery, React, d3.js), Excel & VBA, Python, Clojure, C++. I went to Michigan State University and University of Maryland; they are both state schools and the states' names both start with an "M". I listen to Johnny Cash and Ralph Stanley to focus while working. I support the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/){target="_blank"}.

I always welcome new work opportunities; other than this, the current life priority is to replace my 2014 Fiat 500 with a light truck, or at least something I could lay flat in.
